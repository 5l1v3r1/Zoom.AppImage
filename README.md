# Zoom.AppImage

An AppImage for the Zoom desktop application (until Zoom provides an official one).

__PLEASE NOTE:__ In general, you should download AppImages only from the original authors of the software (here: https://zoom.us/), but since they are not yet providing one I am offering this here. Please contact them if you would like to see an official one. Running applications from random third parties is a security risk. Always get your applications straight from the original authors, and only run applications the authors of which you really trust.
